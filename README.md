# üéß Icecast Secure Metadata Gateway

A simple, safe, and unsanctioned workaround for when your DevOps team says:  
_"Let‚Äôs just expose everything, like in the good old days."_

## üß† Problem: The Player Doesn't Parse, the DevOps Don‚Äôt Care

This project originated from a real-world integration issue:

- A **web/mobile radio player** couldn‚Äôt extract metadata from the Icecast-KH stream (due to persistent, unresolved bugs).
- Instead of fixing the player, the DevOps team suggested:
  > _"Can we just use `status-json.xsl` like we used to?"_

Unfortunately, that legacy endpoint exposes everything:
- All **stream mountpoints**, including hidden and testing streams
- **Listener counts** and server identity
- Internals Icecast-KH never intended to be public

Exposing this on the internet?  
Nope. That‚Äôs how radio privacy dies ‚Äî with lazy configuration.

## üîß Solution: Proxy the Metadata, Not the Problem

So instead of arguing, I built a quiet little workaround.

### üß≠ Key idea:
Extract the one useful thing ‚Äî **the current track** ‚Äî  
and expose just that, cleanly and safely, without touching Icecast itself.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

```text
[BROADCAST SYSTEM] 
     ‚¨á generates XML

[SECURE SERVER]
     ‚¨Ö pulls XML via SFTP
     ‚¨á watches for updates with inotify
     ‚¨á parses + filters data
     ‚¨á outputs clean JSON (status-json.xsl)
     ‚¨Ü served via hardened NGINX

[WEB PLAYER]
     ‚¨Ö fetches only what it needs
```
---

``` Sample JSON Output
{
  "icestats": {
    "source": [
      {
        "title": "Sample Title - Sample Artist"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

‚ùó Why This Is Public
This is not a tutorial.
This is not a "fun side project."
This is a real production fix that:
Solved a business problem
Respected security principles
Avoided breaking the existing stack
And maybe, just maybe, it'll help someone else avoid shouting into the void during a Friday deploy.
